# future_pose_estimator
Predict near future pose estimation for F1/10th car in front using April Tags. Written by Christopher Kao for EAS 499 engineering senior thesis.

# Summary
The goal of this package is to reliably predict the near future pose of a F1/10 car that is in front of our F1/10 car. 
Specifically, this package returns the estimated pose of a car 1 second in the future. It provides 10 predictions: for 0.1 second in the future, 0.2 seconds, ..., up to 1.0 seconds in the future.
